# UFOs

## Overview of Project

### Purpose 

The purpose of this analysis is to build a webpage using JavaScript components and create a table to organize UFO data, stored as a JavaScript array. This table has the ability to filter data based on certain criteria that reacts to user input.

### Background

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

When the client enters the webpage, they will see the title in the nagivation bar, page header, article title, and article summary.

To use the new webpage, scroll down to the Filter Search. A search can filtered by date, city, state, country, and/or shape. To perform a search, add criteria to the search bars and press enter. Multiple filters can be applied in a search.

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.




## Summary

A drawback of this new design is the deleted search button. Although you can perform a search by pressing enter, a search button would make the site more user-friendly.

### Reccomendations for Further Development

1. Find a larger dataset.
2. Include a column that displays the number of people who saw or reported each siting.
